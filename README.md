# pixel_art_maker
This is another project from udacity: Piexl art maker.

In this project we were reqired to build a single-page web app that allows to drw pixel art on a 
customable canvas.

A starter code was provide including HTML and CSS, to build the application. I was required
to write write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design,
and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

 users should be able to:
     >Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
     >Choose a color.
     >Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
